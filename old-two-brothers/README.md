This is an older project I decided to redo as I've gained experience since then and I would like to take more time designing the project.

## Prerequisites

To install/run this development server, you will need to install [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and you will need access to a command prompt or terminal.

## Getting Started

First, you will need to download the required modules:
```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
